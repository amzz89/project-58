    <p>Hi<br>
    <div class="line"></div>
    I am Ameena Abdul Azeez an Electronics and Instrumentation engineering graduate,a teacher at one of the leading coding companies and a mother to 2 kids.
    <br><br>I am passionate about making working model of things and especially love working with electronic components and making circuits using them. The hobby came into life when my elder son got keen into making models and asked for my help on the same.<br>

    <br>Some of the models we made include an elctronic motor powered boat, hydrogen ballooons , sky lanterns and so on..
